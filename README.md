# hiQ (Eigen version)

Starter template in C++ for generating high-quality images. Includes FreeImage
for image output, and Eigen for linear algebra (matrices, vectors,
numerical solvers, and related algorithms).

Uses CMake build, including scripts to find dependencies.

On OSX use Homebrew to install FreeImage and Eigen dependencies.
